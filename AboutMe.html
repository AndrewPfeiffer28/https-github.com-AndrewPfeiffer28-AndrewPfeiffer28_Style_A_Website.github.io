        <p class="olive-drab">Hey, I am a student studying Information Technology at Concordia University Nebraska. I have a special interest in network administration, scripting, and Linux. 
         I am in my senior year of college and enjoy hanging out with friends and playing 
         video games on the weekends when I have time. Additionally, I play trombone in the school band, work for the school IT department, and enjoy running/lifting weights. 
         There are more hobbies I have as well that I enjoy when not at school.
        </p>

        <p class="dusty-rose">My favorite hobby to do when I am not at school or working is woodworking. I enjoy building things out of wood whether it be a small box, 
        a large cabinet, or a bowl on the lathe. Woodworking is an enjoyable and rewarding hobby, not to mention a practical one. Sometimes I build projects for friends
        and family. It is extremely gratifying to reveal to someone the finished project after working on it for a few weeks.
